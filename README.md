### Contribute

To make a pull request, you will need a GitHub account; if you're unclear on this process, see GitHub's documentation on [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

Rebase your local changes against the master branch. Resolve any conflicts that arise.

Pull requests will be treated as "review requests", and we will give feedback we expect to see corrected on style and substance before pulling. Changes contributed via pull request should focus on a single issue at a time, like any other. We will not look kindly on pull-requests that try to "sneak" unrelated changes in.  Note for bug fixes, regression tests should be included, denoted by Issue Number so that we have full traceability.
